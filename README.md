## Getting Started

1.  **Get the code:** Clone the GitHub repository or download the files.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nitra-Global/Project-AdUI.git](https://github.com/Nitra-Global/Project-AdUI.git)
    ```
2.  **Include Styles and Script:** Link the main CSS and JS files in your HTML. Place the CSS in the `<head>` and the JS at the end of the `<body>`.
    ```html
    <head>
        <link href="[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap)" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
    </body>
    ```
3.  **Add Component HTML:** Find the HTML for the ad format you need in the `/components` folder and copy-paste it into your page.
4.  **Insert Ad Content:** Replace the placeholder content within the HTML with your actual ad creative (images, text, links, etc.). Make sure your ad content is also accessible (like using `alt` text for images).
